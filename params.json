{"name":"Lobbying","tagline":"Analysis with the Lobbying Disclosure Database","body":"# Lobbying Disclosures\r\nPhillip Hetzel  \r\nApril 24, 2015  \r\n\r\n##Objective\r\nI didn't think I was going to be able to do any work on quantifying lobbying data; however I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that lobbying entities had to disclose their activities to the public (here's the [link to the data](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm).  I want to answer a couple of questions with this data:\r\n\r\n* What entities lobby the hardest?\r\n* What issues are lobbied the hardest\r\n\r\n##The Data\r\nMy initial discovery of the data was tempered when I viewed how it was stored: XML.  Not only is the data in XML, but most of the data is stored in XML attributes.  Rather than turn back, I decided to push forward with the hope that I'd be able to learn the XPath querying language to adequately parse the data in to a more manageable format.  I've linked [one particular website](http://gastonsanchez.com/work/webdata/getting_web_data_r4_parsing_xml_html.pdf) that helped me learn XML in R.  \r\n\r\nI've decided to take a relational database approach with the XML schema.  Below, I've included the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of what the database schema would look like for the XML files.  In this analysis, we will not be including the Lobbying or Gov't Entity entities.\r\n\r\n![Lobbying Entity Relationship Diagram](Lobbying_ERD.png)\r\n\r\n##Set Up\r\n\r\nI know I'm going to have to deal with an XML file, so I load the XML package in R.  I also set my working directory and clear my memory.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nrequire(XML)\r\nrequire(dplyr)\r\nrequire(ggplot2)\r\nsetwd(\"~/R Working Directory/Lobbying_Data/\")\r\nrm(list=ls())\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Getting the Data\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the most recent data, I download the file directly from the source.  I know it will come in a .zip file, so I unzip the file into my working directory and list all of the files into a vector to loop over.  I also create blank data frames that I will place my parsed XML into.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n#Download the file directly from the government, then unzip into a directory\r\ndownload.file('http://soprweb.senate.gov/downloads/2015_1.zip', '2015_1.zip', method = 'curl')\r\ndownload.file('http://soprweb.senate.gov/downloads/2015_2.zip', '2015_2.zip', method = 'curl')\r\nunzip('2015_1.zip', exdir = '2015_1')\r\nunzip('2015_2.zip', exdir = '2015_1')\r\n\r\n#Place all items in this directory into a vector\r\nfiles <- dir('2015_1')\r\n\r\n#Create blank data frames to append to later\r\nfiling <- data.frame()\r\nregistrant <- data.frame()\r\nclient <- data.frame()\r\nissues <- data.frame()\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Transforming the Data\r\nThe plan with parsing out the data falls in line with the ERD above. We will use XPath to navigate to the correct nodes and collect their attributes into columns.  In order to write a minimal amount of code, we will loop through the files that we have downloaded and combined their data into `filing`, `client`, `registrant`, and `issue` data frames.  The general process for each data frame will be:\r\n\r\n1. Use XPath to gather attributes\r\n2. Place XPath attributes into vectors\r\n3. Create a temporary data frame with the vectors\r\n4. Use `rbind` to aggregate the temporary data frames\r\n\r\n####Filing\r\nBelow we are creating the `filing` data frame.  The `xpathSApply` function calls are used to navigate to all nodes satisfying the query, while the `xmlGetAttr` is used to extract individual attributes from the XML nodes.  In order to make relationships later on in our analysis, we take the RegistrantID and ClientID attributes and place them in the `filing` data frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nfor (file in files){\r\n    \r\n    data <- xmlParse(paste('2015_1/',file,sep = \"\"), useInternalNodes = T)\r\n    \r\n    #Filing Key data frame using the XPath language.\r\n    filingID <- xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing\", xmlGetAttr, 'ID')\r\n    year <- xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing\", xmlGetAttr, 'Year')\r\n    received <- xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing\", xmlGetAttr, 'Received')\r\n    amount <- as.numeric(xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing\", xmlGetAttr, 'Amount'))\r\n    reg <- xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing/Registrant\", xmlGetAttr, 'RegistrantID')\r\n    clientID <- xpathSApply(data, '/PublicFilings/Filing/Client', xmlGetAttr, 'ClientID')\r\n    \r\n    temp <- data.frame(FilingID = filingID, RegistrantID = reg, Date = received, \r\n                       Year = year, Amount = amount, ClientID = clientID, stringsAsFactors = F)\r\n    filing <- rbind(filing, temp)\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Client\r\nThe `client` data frame has a one to one relationship with the `filing` data frame.  One extra step we take towards the end of this code block is to only include unique `clientID`s into the data frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n    #Client Key data frame\r\n    clientID <- xpathSApply(data, '/PublicFilings/Filing/Client', xmlGetAttr, 'ClientID')\r\n    clientName <- xpathSApply(data, '/PublicFilings/Filing/Client', xmlGetAttr, 'ClientName')\r\n    clientState <- xpathSApply(data, '/PublicFilings/Filing/Client', xmlGetAttr, 'ClientState')\r\n    clientCountry <- xpathSApply(data, '/PublicFilings/Filing/Client', xmlGetAttr, 'ClientCountry')\r\n    clientDesc <- xpathSApply(data, '/PublicFilings/Filing/Client', xmlGetAttr, 'GeneralDescription')\r\n    \r\n    ctemp <- data.frame(clientID = clientID, Name = clientName, State = clientState,\r\n                        Country = clientCountry, Description = clientDesc,\r\n                        stringsAsFactors = F)\r\n    client <- rbind(client, ctemp)\r\n    cdups <- duplicated(client[,c('clientID', 'Name')])\r\n    client <- client[!cdups,]\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Registrant\r\nThe `registrant` data frame's process is identical to the `client` data frame's process.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n    #Registrant Key data frame\r\n    regNum <- xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing/Registrant\", xmlGetAttr, 'RegistrantID')\r\n    regName <-xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing/Registrant\", xmlGetAttr, 'RegistrantName')\r\n    regAd <-xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing/Registrant\", xmlGetAttr, 'Address')\r\n    regDesc <-xpathSApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing/Registrant\", xmlGetAttr, 'GeneralDescription')\r\n    rtemp <- data.frame(RegistrantID = regNum, Name = regName, Address = regAd,\r\n                        Description = regDesc, stringsAsFactors = F)\r\n    registrant <- rbind(registrant, rtemp)\r\n    dups <- duplicated(registrant[,c('RegistrantID', 'Name')])\r\n    registrant <- registrant[!dups,]\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Issues\r\nThe `issues` data frame is much more complicated than the others, because of its one-to-many relationship with the `filing` data frame.  To start, let's break down what the goal is: for every `filingID`, we want to gather the issues that are associated with it. So for every Filing node, I want to grab the ID attribute, then grab the Code and SpecificIssue attributes within the Issue child node. If there is not an issue associated with a filing, we can mark it as NA and filter it out later.  `xpathApply` will return a list, therefore we can rap that function in `dplyr`'s `rbind_all` function.\r\n\r\nThe code below was inspired by this [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17349630/r-dataframe-from-xml-when-values-are-multiple-or-missing) post.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n    #Issues Key data frame. Issues are one to many with FilingID\r\n    itemp <- rbind_all(xpathApply(data, \"/PublicFilings/Filing\", function(node) {\r\n        id <- xmlGetAttr(node, \"ID\")\r\n        xp <- \".//Issue\"\r\n        issueCode <- xpathSApply(node, xp, xmlGetAttr, 'Code')\r\n        issueDesc <- xpathSApply(node, xp, xmlGetAttr, 'SpecificIssue')\r\n        if (length(issueCode)==0){\r\n            issueCode = NA\r\n            issueDesc = NA\r\n        }#if statement close\r\n        \r\n        data.frame(FilingID=id, Type=issueCode, Description = issueDesc, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)})\r\n        )#rbind_all close\r\n    \r\n    issues <- rbind(issues, itemp)\r\n    issues <- issues[!is.na(issues$Type),]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Cleaning up\r\n\r\nCongratulations! All of the hard work is finished.  Now we can transform the data type of the `Date` column and delete some data from our memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nfiling$Date <- as.Date(filing$Date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\r\n\r\n#Delete everything except data frames from memory\r\nremove(reg, ctemp, rtemp, temp, amount, data, file, files, filingID, \r\n               received, regAd, regName, regNum, year, clientCountry, clientDesc,\r\n       clientID, clientName, clientState, dups, cdups, regDesc, itemp)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##What entities lobby the most?\r\nLet's take a quick look at what entities are the most active.  To do this, we will prepare a new data frame, `by_registrant` that will show `filing` data grouped by `RegistrantID` and summarized by both dollar amount and number of filings.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n#Create data frame that shows the amount spent by each registrant\r\nby_registrant <- filing %>%\r\n    group_by(RegistrantID) %>%\r\n    summarise(Amount = sum(Amount,na.rm = T), Number = n()) %>%\r\n    filter(Amount > 0, Number > 0) %>%\r\n    left_join(registrant) %>%\r\n    arrange(desc(Amount))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, let get to know this data a little bit better by making a scatter plot of the `Amount` spent and the `Number` of filings.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nggplot(by_registrant, aes(x = Number, y = Amount)) + geom_point()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](Lobbying_files/figure-html/plot1-1.png) \r\n\r\nThis plot is interesting because it shows that the registrants that spend the most on lobbying usually only have one associated filing. Let's look at the top ten registrants in terms of `Amount`.  The `reorder` function is used to create an order factor variable, based on another variable in the data frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nby_registrant$Name <- reorder(by_registrant$Name, -by_registrant$Amount)\r\n\r\nggplot(by_registrant[1:10,], aes(x = Name, y = Amount)) + \r\n    geom_bar(stat='identity', data = by_registrant[1:10,], aes(fill = Name)) + \r\n    scale_x_discrete(labels=NULL)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](Lobbying_files/figure-html/plot2-1.png) \r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce comes out on top by a hefty margin (they have led the pack in lobbying expenditures for the [past decade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce#Lobbying_expenditures)).  \r\n\r\n#What issues are lobbied the hardest?\r\n\r\nIn order to find the hardest lobbied issues, we'll create a new data frame called `num_issues`. We trim down the `filing` data frame by using the `select` function.  We then shape the issues data frame using `dplyr`.  Since we are aggregating at the issue level, we will `group_by` the `Type` variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nselect_filing <- select(filing, FilingID, Amount)\r\n\r\nnum_issues <- issues %>%\r\n    left_join(select_filing) %>%\r\n    group_by(Type) %>%\r\n    summarise(TotalNumber = n(), TotalDollars = sum(Amount, na.rm = T)) %>%\r\n    arrange(desc(TotalDollars))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that we have a new data frame, we can make a bar plot of the top 10 lobbying issues.  \r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\nnum_issues$Type <- reorder(num_issues$Type, -num_issues$TotalNumber)\r\n\r\nggplot(num_issues[1:10,], aes(x = Type, y = TotalNumber)) +\r\n    geom_bar(stat='identity', data = num_issues[1:10,], aes(fill= Type)) +\r\n    scale_x_discrete(labels= NULL)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![](Lobbying_files/figure-html/plot3-1.png) \r\n\r\nBudget/Appropriations issues come out on top!  While this probably wasn't the sexy outcome we were hoping for, this graph helps to show the most lobbied issues in government.\r\n\r\n##Conclusion\r\nThere you have it!  This was a quick look at some publicly available lobbying data.  Eventually, I will be making a Shiny app that will allow for some user control of the data set.
